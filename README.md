# NearBy Connection API - P2P_STAR 
Nearby Connections enables advertising and discovery of nearby devices, as well as high-bandwidth low-latency encrypted data transfers between these devices in a fully-offline P2P manner.It achieves this by using a combination of classic Bluetooth, BLE, and Wi-Fi hotspots.

# P2P_STAR
P2P_STAR is a peer-to-peer strategy that supports a 1-to-N, or star-shaped, connection topology. In other words, this enables connecting devices within radio range (~100m) in a star shape, where each device can, at any given time, play the role of either a hub (where it can accept incoming connections from N other devices), or a spoke (where it can initiate an outgoing connection to a single hub), but not both.
